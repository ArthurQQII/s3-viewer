App Name (TBD)
A smooth, modern S3 browser for desktop built with Golang

Purpose
Provide users with a fast, clean, and efficient way to browse and preview their S3 buckets and objects using existing AWS CLI credentials.

Target Platform
- Desktop (macOS, Windows, Linux)
- Built using Golang
- GUI powered by frameworks like Fyne, Wails, or Lorca for sleek UI and animation

Key Features

1. Credential Selection Page
- Reads AWS CLI profiles (from ~/.aws/credentials and ~/.aws/config)
- Let users choose:
  - default profile
  - Another named profile
- Instructions to configure via terminal if no valid credential is found

2. Bucket Listing Page
- Displays all accessible S3 buckets
- Pagination: 10 / 20 buckets per page
- Features:
  - Search by bucket name
  - Next / Previous navigation
- Animation for transitions between states (profile -> bucket list)

3. Bucket Explorer Page
- Lists contents of a selected bucket
- Columns:
  - Name (folder/object)
  - Last modified
  - Type (folder, file extension)
- Features:
  - Pagination: 20 / 50 items per page
  - Sorting: Name, Type, Last Modified
  - Search/filter by name
- Folder navigation with breadcrumb path UI

4. File Preview Window
- Previews for:
  - Images (JPG, PNG, etc.)
  - Text/JSON
  - PDFs
- Opens in a clean, separate modal or window
- Supports zoom, scroll, basic formatting

UX/UI Goals
- Apple-inspired minimal design
- Smooth transitions and loading indicators
- Responsive layout
- Dark mode / light mode toggle (optional)

Tech Stack
- Golang
  - aws-sdk-go-v2 for interacting with S3
- Frontend Framework (UI layer)
  - Fyne (fully Go, modern and native-feel)
  - OR Wails (Go backend + modern JS frontend)
- Bundled as a native desktop app for each platform

Security Considerations
- No credential storage in-app
- Relies fully on AWS CLI configuration
- Only makes calls using local profile credentials

Future Ideas
- Drag-and-drop upload/download
- Multi-bucket management
- Bookmark folders or files
- CloudFront URL generator
- IAM policy view for each bucket (read-only)
